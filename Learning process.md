   - 6/18/2023 started building a self-designed object, the Traditional Korean food Injulmi.
   - 6/20/2023 for the Injulmi's texture of powdery I might use the Dust Feature. (using sand texture made it worse it ruined the cute feeling of the circular Items.)
   - 6/21/2023 Injulmi's texture the powdery, and I used the particles for the foggy and dusty. It wasn't that good but it might be better if these particles are on the Injulmi itself.

   - 6/19/2023 AWS Control Flow Lecture started
   - 6/20/2023 AWS Control Flow done
   - 6/21/2023 AWS Functions started it is about building basic functions in Python.
   - 6/22/2023 AWS Function Done!
   - 6/23/2023 AWS Anaconda Install - Its already installed
   - 6/27/2023 Building first project - using parser(it is more like getting a file info storing), os(makeing output dict, it is more like calling files and making as a list)

   - 7/28/2023 Matplotlib - violin & box --> seaborn
   - 7/28/2023 Matplotlib - Categorical Plot --> setting up the data is a bit hard
   - 8/01/2023 Linear Combination - concept is easy but not sure about how should i solve this
4. Game Idea Memo
   - Games that don't need language
   - 2D or 3D
   - Could be Web-based & Unreal Engine
   - rather than Drawing I want it to be more mood
   - better to be healing
   - wants to contain memories
   - or recall memories
   - memories with parents might be good too
   - Voice Recording - or video storytelling ish?
   - I am not good at 2D drawings
   - Similar to princess maker according to the sentiment analysis
   - 
5. Building TTS bot
   - Recorded the voice data (meta Deta)
   - ML is done
   - working on the server part
   - asked about the error
