  ![Alt text](Creation/House.png)
  
   - 6/18/2023 started building a self-designed object, the Traditional Korean food Injulmi.
   - 6/20/2023 for the Injulmi's texture of powdery I might use the Dust Feature. (using sand texture made it worse it ruined the cute feeling of the circular Items.)
   - 6/21/2023 Injulmi's texture the powdery, and I used the particles for the foggy and dusty. It wasn't that good but it might be better if these particles are on the Injulmi itself.

4. Game Idea Memo
   - Games that don't need language
   - 2D or 3D
   - Could be Web-based & Unreal Engine
   - rather than Drawing I want it to be more mood
   - better to be healing
   - wants to contain memories
   - or recall memories
   - memories with parents might be good too
   - Voice Recording - or video storytelling ish?
   - I am not good at 2D drawings
   - Similar to princess maker according to the sentiment analysis
   - 
5. Building TTS bot
   - Recorded the voice data (meta Deta)
   - ML is done
   - working on the server part
   - asked about the error
6. Data Analyst Study
   - Done 3rd part of the course
   - Working on the practice of SQL & Spread Sheet
